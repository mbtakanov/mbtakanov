## Hi there 👋

I'm Marin, a passionate Senior Software Engineer with a love for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. My journey in technology has been driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning. I view myself as a language-agnostic engineer, working confidently across the entire stack..

With over a decade of experience in various modern technologies I bring a versatile skill set to every project. I possess strong critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, along with a high level of ownership and accountability. I'm self-motivated and proactive, with the ability to adapt to diverse tech stacks and translate business requirements into effective technical solutions.

Beyond work, I enjoy exploring machine learning and make the most of my time with my family.
